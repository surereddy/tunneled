# Tunneled

Tunneled is an application to assist in viewing webhook deliveries. It provides
the pieces of an HTTP request in your terminal, as they come in, broken up by
colors.

It's meant to be used in conjunction with a reverse SSH tunnel like:

```
$ ssh -nNT -R 80:localhost:8000 root@bswinnerton.tunneled.computer
```

It looks something like this:

In order to set up a server of your choice to support reverse tunnels, add the
following to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```
AllowTcpForwarding yes
GatewayPorts yes
```
